# Description
The Membership Management System is a web application built with Django that allows administrators to manage users and their memberships. This system supports the registration of users, tracking of their membership details, and management of gym class subscriptions. Users can be assigned different membership types, and the system keeps track of their membership start and end dates. Additionally, administrators can update membership statuses (active or inactive), view user details, and manage gym class subscriptions.
